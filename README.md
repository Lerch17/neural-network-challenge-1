# neural-network-challenge-1
Module 18 Challenge

This HW challenge was comlepted by myself. 

I was able to build this model with the help of previous class examples and a little help from microsoft co-pilot.
The only issue I ran into for the first time was that my prediction numbers (continuous values) were not in the same format as my y_test(binary). to fix this, I used co-pilot to help me convert my predictions into binary form so that I could print out my classification results.
